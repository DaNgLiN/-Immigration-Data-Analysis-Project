  MAE: "Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is a measure of errors between paired observations expressing the same phenomenon. It calculates the average of the absolute differences between predictions and actual observations.",
  MSE: "Mean Squared Error (MSE) is the average of the squares of the errors. It measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual observations.",
  RMSE: "Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is the square root of the average of squared differences between prediction and actual observation. RMSE is a frequently used measure of the differences between values predicted by a model and the values observed.",
  R2: "R-squared (R2) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). It indicates how well the observed outcomes are replicated by the model, based on the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model.",
  "Explained Variance":
    "Explained Variance is the proportion of the dataset's total variance that is explained by the model. It quantifies the amount of variability in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in a regression model.",
